    <h2><u>About My Website!</u></h2>

    <h3>This website was designed to help teach people the art of
        origami! Many people believe that origami is very complex and 
        hard, however, that isn't true. Origami is actually quite 
        simple, and is extremely relaxing. In this website I have listed
        several of my favorite origami animals to fold. I hope that you
         find this website useful and develop a passion for origami!
